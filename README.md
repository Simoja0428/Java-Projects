# Java-Projects
The following repository contains some of my programming work in Java. Most of my projects make use of the Java Swing Library to provide an interactive GUI with each program. In addition, several programs make use of some very common patterns used in object oriented programming.

## GUI Template
The file in the GUI Template folder is a template program. All the program does is display a GUI window using Java's Swing class. This file contains the bare minimum that is needed to display Java Swing Components to the user on the screen.

## Bitmap Creator
The Bitmap Creator is a program that creates Bitmap files. The integer values of the red, green, and blue of the pixels of the bitmap are stored in one 32 bit integer (red taking the first 8 bits, green taking the second 8, blue taking the third 8). Further this project makes use of an ArrayList in order to then store all the nessecary string data to create the file.
